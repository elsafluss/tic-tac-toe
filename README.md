Elsa's Tic-Tac-Toe game: mod 1 final project

[Here is the spec for this project.](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo.html)

I built this game during the last week of mod 1 at Turing, using everything I'd learned in the past five weeks. Now I can play tic-tac-toe whenever I want, and you can too.

Before you play tic-tac-toe, you should probably know the rules of the game. If you don't, [here's the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), where you can learn more than you ever wanted to. Other than that, there are no prerequisites for playing - everything will happen in your browser. Chrome is, of course, recommended.

## How to play
To play a game, click in any square. Your token will show up in that square. Then let your opponent click in a different square, and their token will appear. When the game is over, the board will reset after a short pause. You can then start your next game by clicking to place your token in any square. Win counts will persist even if you refresh the page.

## Custom tokens?!
If you want to customize your tokens, you can do so easily with a find/replace in index.html and styles.css. More information on how to do this is at the bottom of index.html.

## A pat on the back
I wrote all this code, y'all. Special thanks to my mentor and teachers. I listened to a lot of [Eagles of Death Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagles_of_Death_Metal) during this project. That's another wiki link. Check them out.
